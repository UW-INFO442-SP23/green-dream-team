# The Green Dream Team | Firewise EW

## Created by: Anokhi Shah, Tyrell Garza, Fatima Laghari, Dellina Gebrehiwot, Kathy Thin

## Introduction
Firewise EW is a project created by INFO 442 students designed to address the UN's Sustainable Development (SDG)
#12: Sustainable Cities and Communities.

### Problem Statement:
How might we help renters or homeowners within Eastern Washington
educate themselves regarding prevention and mitigation strategies against wildfires
in order for them to be better prepared?

## Our Mission:
The Green Dream Team is on a mission to provide residents of Eastern Washington information and resources
they can access in the event of a wildfire. Through our project, Firewise EW, we are committed
to providing an easy to understand resource that allows these residents to be better prepared against
wildfires.

## Key Features
- Interactive timeline that showcases the different wildfires that have taken place over 2017-2022.
- Embedded-interactive map that showcases the air quality within Eastern Washington.
- Information of previous fires to provide insight to the problem.
- Additional resources and fundraising opportunities to ensure better preparation for wildfires.

## User Personas
1. Connie is a 72 year-old elderly who lives a retired life with her husband in Malden, Washington, a small farming town in EW. Since the last biggest wildfire that destroyed most of Malden’s buildings and structures back in late 2020, Connie has been much more worried about her health, safety, and overall well-being. This is especially concerning since she struggles with breathing issues while battling lung cancer for the past few years. She keeps up to date weekly with FirewiseEW, mainly using the interactive map and preparedness resources, to gain more insight on what future fire may occur next and to be better prepared.
2. Jake is a 37 year-old man who lives in Clarkston, Washington with his wife and 3 daughters. He has been working a demanding and stressful job as a firefighter for the Clarkston fire department for the past 7 years. Since he spends most of his days helping put out wildfires, Jake and the rest of his team are constantly seeking ways to learn about the wildfire impacts that occur in their surroundings, so they use FirewiseEW to gain a better in-depth analysis of these impacts.

## Testing Protocol

● What are the acceptance tests that your team will perform before beginning user
testing? 

○ Acceptance testing will be the last phase of software testing we perform once we
have the majority of our application implemented. Two of the key features in our
application are an interactive map of wildfires on our homepage, and a timeline of
wildfires from 2017-2022 on our impact page. Before performing end-user
testing, our team will test out the key features by using them as we would
regularly to find any defects we may have missed during the functional testing
phase and to see how well the product has developed. Alpha (internal) and Beta
(external) testing are two main forms of acceptance testing we will be using. With
Beta testing, we would see externally whether or not our interactive map was
actually showing up for end-users, and being able to click and drag, able to filter
location, etc. We would know it failed if it didn’t, and the same thing goes for our
timeline. With Alpha testing, we would look over and review our code for any
bugs or redundancies.

● How will you conduct user testing?

○ Our current plan is to interview students who attend UW and are from Eastern
Washington since they fit our target audience. Additionally, since one of our
members is from Eastern Washington they will be reaching out to family
members for additional feedback as well.. We plan on conducting user testing in
the coming weeks using a low fidelity website to ensure that we are on track and
users can actually benefit from our website. Our current aim is to conduct user
testing twice during the span of this project to ensure that users have access to
features that will be useful and are not redundant. However, we will be
reevaluating our options based on our ability to meet our milestones.

● How will you decide which bugs to fix first?

When deciding which bugs to fix first when creating our website about Eastern
Washington fires, we plan to look at the overall nature of the bugs and their
impact on the website's functionality and usability. Below are some factors we
will consider when prioritizing bug fixes:

1. Severity of the bug: Bugs that impact critical functionality, such as preventing
users from accessing important information or resources, would be prioritized
over bugs that have a minor impact on the website's usability.

2. User feedback: User feedback can provide valuable insights into which bugs
are most impactful for users and which should be prioritized for fixing.

3. Timeline and resources: The urgency and available resources for fixing bugs
would also be a factor in determining which bugs to prioritize. Bugs that are quick
and easy to fix and have a high impact on user experience would be prioritized
over more complex bugs that require significant development resources.

Ultimately, the decision of which bugs to prioritize would depend on a
consideration of these factors in order to ensure that we fulfill our personal goals
for the website as well as the goals for the project.

● How will you re-test the solution after the bug fixes have been completed?

Once we have identified the bugs that need to be fixed, we will re-conduct user
testing to retest the solution. Through multiple rounds of this type of testing, we
can ask targeted questions to our participants to gain a better understanding of
whether the bug has been successfully resolved. We can follow these action steps:

1. Determine the specific scenarios and user paths that were previously
impacted by the bugs and need to be retested again.

2. Begin user usability testing and develop targeted questions/ tasks to assess
whether the bug has been fixed and the website is functioning as expected.

3. Observe participants' interactions with the website and collect feedback on
their experience.

4. Analyze the data collected from the user usability testing to identify any
remaining bugs.

By following these action steps, we can ensure that the bug is fixed and that the
website is functioning as expected. We also will be gathering valuable feedback
from our users to improve the website's usability and overall user experience.


### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
